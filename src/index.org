* Introduction
  The Content Adapter module is a micro-service part of the VLabs
  platform [[https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-platform/blob/refactoring/src/design/index.org][=design=]]. It is responsible for styling the content stored
  in the content server. The Content Adapter module tries to imitate a
  CMS tool.

* Design
  When the web browser makes a request for a particular resource to
  the content server, the latter finds the resource and sends it to
  the Content Adapter. The Content Adapter module receives an unstyled
  HTML template and modifies it based on the stored configuration of
  the adapter. This modified resource is sent back to the content
  server, which in turn forwards it the web browers that originally
  made the request.
